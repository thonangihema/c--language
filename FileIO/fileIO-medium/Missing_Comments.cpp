/*When one writes a function, it is generally a good idea to include a comment that outlines 
the functionâ€™s purpose, its parameters and its return value. However, sometimes 
comments are forgotten, or left out by well-intentioned programmers that plan to write 
them later but then never get around to it. Create a python function findMissingComments
that takes python source file as input and identifies functions that are not immediately 
preceded by a comment. For the purposes of this exercise, assume that any line that 
begins with def, followed by a space, is the beginning of a function definition. Assume 
that the comment character, #, will be the first character on the previous line when the 
function has a comment. Display the names of all of the functions that are missing 
comments, along with line number where the function definition is located.
Write a main program to demonstrate your function.*/
